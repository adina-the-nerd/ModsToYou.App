this project is likely going to remain dormant for a while until I figure out this code base and it might be switched to rust maybe idk it's just the language I'm most comfortable with

I cannot guarantee windows or Mac support for the first version of this as I do not have those systems to test with. I cannot promise that this project will be seen to fluition, and I cannot promise that there will be an update anytime soon but I will try. 


(The main first update will mostly be to change The color scheme (probably going to be purple & black), the server connection so it's not trying to connect to Nexus, a thing to ask for donations if The server starts getting bogged down, Undertale, Deltarune, and Loop Hero mod support. I will say sadly I do not want to deal with app images until I have some more people behind me so flatpaks will be the only officially supported distribution until further notice as they get rid of a lot of the complications of developing applications on Linux.)

PS: I'm dyslexic I have no idea how awful this is I'm using speech to text I'm sorry.
